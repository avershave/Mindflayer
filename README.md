# sploitStreet
## Goals with sploitStreet
- Automation with Metasploit
	- sploitStreet will be able to learn from the infromation it gathers. With the information, it will be able to decide on what the next move it should do. Not every move will be to actually accomplish an exploit. It will try to confuse the user randomly.

## Accomplished so far:
1. Built framework for user input
	- Able to print sessions, jobs, and interact with meterpreter(with output)
	- Currently working with transport within meterpreter
2. Started creating automation
3. Able to parse data using JSON

## TODOS:
Really want a backend to view the commands the program is sending. First idea was using MongoDB because of how it interacts with dictionaries natively.
